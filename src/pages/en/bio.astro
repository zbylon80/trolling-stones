          We launched TRolling Stones in 2015, originally under the name The Rolling Stones Tribute.
          A shared love of rock'n'roll and the urge to share the energy of legendary tracks with the
          audience brought us together. Along the way our name got a little more trollish, but the
          spirit stayed the same: the stage is loud, wild and always with a wink, because rock is as
          much about good fun as it is about music.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Our sound is rich because we are experienced musicians who previously played in bands such
          as Dry and Riverhead. You could call us a supergroup where pure passion meets years of
          stage mileage.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Since the beginning the line-up has changed only once. In 2016 Piotr Abraham joined the
          team, adding extra energy and a healthy dose of humour. We have been going strong ever
          since, and every TRolling Stones show is a burst of energy, big smiles and rock'n'roll
          without brakes.
